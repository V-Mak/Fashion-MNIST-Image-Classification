# Fashion-MNIST-Image-Classification

Fashion-MNIST is a popular dataset for image classification tasks. It serves as a more challenging alternative to the classic MNIST dataset. Fashion-MNIST consists of 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images, with each image being a grayscale 28x28 pixel clothing item from one of 10 different categories. The goal is to train a machine learning model to correctly classify these images into their respective categories.

categories in the Fashion-MNIST dataset are:

* `Label`	`Description`
* `0` `T-shirt/top`
`1` `Trouser`
`2`	`Pullover`
`3`	`Dress`
`4`	`Coat`
`5`	`Sandal`
`6`	`Shirt`
`7`	`Sneaker`
`8`	`Bag`
`9`	`Ankle boot`
